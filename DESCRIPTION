Description: riskspace provides tools for translating spatial insurance exposure into loss-relevant metrics using transparent, reproducible assumptions. The package supports normalization of in-force exposure data, spatial attribution of hazard proximity and intensity, and application of simple damage functions to derive loss proxies. Designed for actuarial, catastrophe modeling, and portfolio risk analysis workflows, riskspace emphasizes explicit spatial assumptions, auditability, and flexibility without relying on proprietary event catalogs or vendor models.
